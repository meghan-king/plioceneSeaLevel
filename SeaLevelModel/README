# SeaLevelModel
Contains a FORTRAN .f90 file as well as several binary and .txt files.
_Kingetal2024_SeaLevelModel_Code.f90_ is the code to run the sea level model. It was written by Sam Goldberg (University of Miami).
_Kingetal2024_SeaLevelModel_InputEarthModels.zip_ is an input into the sea level model. It is a zipped folder containing the earth model binary files. 
_Kingetal2024_SeaLevelModel_OutputSLGrids.zip_ is an output from the sea level model. It is a zipped folder containing binary sea level grids for each ice sheet scenario. The grids are the the difference (i.e., sea-level change) between the KM3 interglacial and M2 glacial. One set of grids are the relative sea-level change, while the other are the normalized sea-level change.
_Kingetal2024_SeaLevelModel_OutputSummaryFiles.zip_ is an output from the sea level model. It is a zipped folder containing text files with the GMSLP values from each earth model run (in the order that they appear in Table 1).
*Note that the other input into the sea level model are the output ice histories produced by the ice model.
