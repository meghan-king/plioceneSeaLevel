# IceModel
Contains MATLAB .m, .mat files as well as a .txt and several binary files. 

_Kingetal2024_IceModel_Code.m_ is the code to run the ice model. 

_Kingetal2024_IceModel_Inputs18O.txt_ is an input into the ice model. It is a .txt file containing a portion of the LR04 d18O stack. 

_Kingetal2024_IceModel_InputIceGeometries1.m_ and _Kingetal2024_IceModel_InputIceGeometries1.m_ are inputs into the ice model. They are MATLAB workspaces containing the ice snapshot geometries.

_Kingetal2024_IceModel_OutputIceHistories.zip_ is the output from the ice model. It is a zipped folder containing the ice316 and ice456 binary files from each ice sheet. The full ice histories are too large to include here, but are avaialable upon request.
